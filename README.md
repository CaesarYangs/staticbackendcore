# StaticBackend - simple backend for web & mobile apps

[StaticBackend](https://staticbackend.com) is a simple backend that handles 
user management, database, file storage, and real-time experiences via a 
channel/topic-based communication for web and mobile applications.

You can think of it as a lightweight Firebase replacement you may self-host. No 
vendor lock-in, and your data stays in your control. You may contribute to the 
product.

We've decided to open the core of the product and have a permissive license 
with the MIT license.

We [provide a CLI](https://staticbackend.com/getting-started/) for local 
development if you want to get things started without any infrastructure and 
for prototyping.
